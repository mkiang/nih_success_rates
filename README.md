# `nih_success_rates`

Some quick exploratory looks at the [NIH Success Rates
data](https://report.nih.gov/success_rates/) for early career awards
(i.e,. “K-awards”) and major independent awards (e.g., R01, DP2, etc.)

## Warning

This was started fairly quickly over a lunch break — it almost certainly
has errors.

## Shiny app

I’ve made a very crude Shiny app. To run it, use the following command
*on your local RStudio instance*:

    shiny::runGitHub("mkiang/nih_success_rates")
